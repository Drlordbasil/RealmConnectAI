# Autonomous Content Recommendation System

## Description

The Autonomous Content Recommendation System is a Python project that aims to provide personalized content recommendations to users based on their search queries. Unlike traditional web scraping methods, this system utilizes the requests library to send search queries to search engines and retrieve relevant URLs without violating any web scraping policies or terms of service.

The system utilizes various tools and libraries, such as BeautifulSoup and Google Python, to extract information and metadata from web pages. It leverages HuggingFace small models for natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition. With these capabilities, the system can analyze the content of web pages and extract key information to understand user preferences and interests.

Using content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms, the system generates personalized recommendations by matching user interests with similar content available on the web. It utilizes similarity metrics to ensure relevance and accuracy in the recommendation generation process. The recommendations can include various types of resources, such as images, videos, or text files, which are dynamically downloaded from the web and stored in an organized manner for fast retrieval.

The system is designed to be autonomous and scalable. It continuously performs search queries, retrieves relevant URLs, and updates the recommendation model without human intervention. It can handle a large volume of search queries and recommendations, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

To enhance user interaction and feedback, the system incorporates a user interface or chatbot. Users can provide feedback on recommended content, which is then used to improve the recommendation model and enhance the relevance and accuracy of future recommendations.

The project also ensures error handling and safety measures. It includes mechanisms to handle unsuccessful search queries or URL retrieval. Additionally, privacy and security measures are implemented to respect web scraping policies and terms of service while accessing and analyzing web content.
